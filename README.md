- 👋 Hi, I’m @Abeocc
- 👀 I’m interested in all manner of reading and writing (hopefully will learn to read and write all sorts of code!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Groovy and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Groovy and Python projects.
- 📫 How to reach me? I'm not famous enough for that yet!
